**Pet Name Selector App**
A React-based web application to help users select the perfect name for their pet. The app provides a list of names for both boys and girls, allows users to approve, reject, or mark names as "maybe," and displays a dynamic list of approved names.

**Features**
Dynamic Name Display: Displays one name at a time, randomly selected based on the chosen gender.
Approval System: Users can approve ("Yay"), reject ("Nay"), or reconsider ("Meh") names.
Gender Selection: Switch between boys' and girls' names with easy-to-use buttons.
Styled Components: The app uses styled-components for styling, including animations for a sleek user experience.
